# Neuro-computational
<br>Part 1 - Write the data, handwriting each letter 3 times and then rotate each of them 15 degrees and -15 degrees. Then we record each of them into a matrix where +1 for an entry which has a part of the letter, and -1 for the others. Then we entered each matrix into a vector with an extantion of the vector in position 0 - "1" if the latter is "bet", "2" if the latter is "lamed" and "3" if the latter is "mem".
<br>
<br>Part 2 - Adaline, Build a classifier using the Adaline algorithm which classifies letters. We had to encode a classifier that is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. We should have done this 5 times, so all the data is used for training and testing.
Classify “mem” versus “bet”, classify “lamed” versus “bet”, and classify “lamed” versus “mem”. 
<br>
<br>Part 3 - Feed forward, replace the Adaline with a feed forward neural network. Repeat the classifications from earlier parts.
